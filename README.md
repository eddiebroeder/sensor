# sensor
This is a tool to monitor a motion sensor attached to a Raspberry Pi and record a picture and video if the sensor is triggered, using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module.

The pictures and videos are hosted using apache.

An email/text notification is sent when the sensor is triggered, and contains links to the hosted picture and video.

The iOS app can be used to arm/disarm the sensor, as well as to check status and view the most recent picture taken.
